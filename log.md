# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: January 11, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: A good day all round today I got the blog and the twitter feed to display on the website.  Next is to make those refresh at a certain rate and look to embed events from google calendar and facebook posts

**Thoughts:** Tired but happy however keeping this up is going to face some challenges.  No least because if February work are sending me on a intensive 5 day course in London to learn C# not sure how much coding I would want to do each night after that.

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start 100 days of code .

**Thoughts:** Going to do this an hopefully stick with it.  First Project website for Community Group I work with.  I am however adding rules for me.

Stephen Rule 1:  May be days where due to childcare commitments 1 hour will not be possible.  Will do extra on other days to make up.

Stephen Rule 2:  Coding I do for my job will not count but extra stuff I do during lunch will count.
