# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: January 19, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Well today was intense, since last year I have been helping set up a code club for kids age 7 - 12.  Today we had 27 kids turn up which was great but so much work.  While the code they are doing is not challenging I do spend a lot of time explaining key programming concepts to them so I am counting it as part of my coding for today.  After that I was a bit brain dead so have done a simple UI design using the tools in visual studio.  It is something that was needed for the c# course I am going on so I thought I would get it out the way.
**Thoughts:** Loads of project idea have come out of the code club for what I could do.  First 2 that spring to mind an achievment monitoring service or doing my own simple gaem

### Day 15: January 19, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Today it was back to the website and learning Javascript libraries.  Today I was learning JQuery which people say makes things easier to code.  I can see it use in making animation on website so am going to try it.  Not much to show for it though to day was more of a learning day.

**Thoughts:** Getting increasing concerned about how slow I am going.  Maybe I need to make mine 200 days of code to achieve what other people can do in 100.

### Day 14: January 18, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Bit of a token effort today.  As soon as I was back from work I was out at a community meeting.  Got home and did a introduction to Python to remind myself of the syntax.  The code club I volunteer at uses it as a coding of minecraft so was refreshing myself on that.  Will look to expand on that an write longer code to do impressive things in minecraft for raspberry pi.

**Thoughts:** which programming languages would get together and decide once and for all if true and false start with capitals or not

### Day 13: January 17, 2018

**Thoughts:** Still slow going I thought I could code quicker than this

### Day 12: January 16, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Interesting coding today I did something a bit different went to a local tech meet up and did some coding on Sonic Pi on a raspberry Pi.  Interesting getting a really different language but it was let down a little by my lack of musical ability

**Thoughts:** Not too much today

### Day 11: January 15, 2018

### Day 10: January 14, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Implemented more API to get facebook running on the website.  Still looking to get information from Google Calendars in a way that I can then manipulate them

**Thoughts:** Make a web server how?

### Day 9: January 13, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Did a bit of coding but was mostly just trying to get things to look right using CSS.  I have started reading the Google Calendar API which may be a bit harder than the blogger API to get info from 

**Thoughts:** Had a meeting with people today about continuing to develop a tech club and tech meetup in Chesterfield so am keeping up the networking as well.  Looked at the course that work is sending me on and it turns out they will expect a basic knowledge of visual studio so I am going to have to spend a bit more time getting to know that paricular IDE.

### Day 7: January 11, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: A good day all round today I got the blog and the twitter feed to display on the website.  Next is to make those refresh at a certain rate and look to embed events from google calendar and facebook posts

**Thoughts:** Tired but happy however keeping this up is going to face some challenges.  No least because if February work are sending me on a intensive 5 day course in London to learn C# not sure how much coding I would want to do each night after that.

**Thoughts:** Going to do this an hopefully stick with it.  First Project website for Community Group I work with.  I am however adding rules for me.

Stephen Rule 1:  May be days where due to childcare commitments 1 hour will not be possible.  Will do extra on other days to make up.

Stephen Rule 2:  Coding I do for my job will not count but extra stuff I do during lunch will count.
