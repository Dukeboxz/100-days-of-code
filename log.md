# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 4, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Decided to start 100 days of code .

**Thoughts:** Going to do this an hopefully stick with it.  First Project website for Community Group I work with.  I am however adding rules for me.

Stephen Rule 1:  May be days where due to childcare commitments 1 hour will not be possible.  Will do extra on other days to make up.

Stephen Rule 2:  Coding I do for my job will not count but extra stuff I do during lunch will count.

### Day 1: January 5, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Started on a basic volunteer page still have a lot of work to do

**Thoughts:** It is amazing how long non coding things like finding images can take
