# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: January 13, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Implemented more API to get facebook running on the website.  Still looking to get information from Google Calendars in a way that I can then manipulate them

**Thoughts:** Make a web server how?

### Day 9: January 13, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Did a bit of coding but was mostly just trying to get things to look right using CSS.  I have started reading the Google Calendar API which may be a bit harder than the blogger API to get info from 

**Thoughts:** Had a meeting with people today about continuing to develop a tech club and tech meetup in Chesterfield so am keeping up the networking as well.  Looked at the course that work is sending me on and it turns out they will expect a basic knowledge of visual studio so I am going to have to spend a bit more time getting to know that paricular IDE.

### Day 7: January 11, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: A good day all round today I got the blog and the twitter feed to display on the website.  Next is to make those refresh at a certain rate and look to embed events from google calendar and facebook posts

**Thoughts:** Tired but happy however keeping this up is going to face some challenges.  No least because if February work are sending me on a intensive 5 day course in London to learn C# not sure how much coding I would want to do each night after that.

Stephen Rule 1:  May be days where due to childcare commitments 1 hour will not be possible.  Will do extra on other days to make up.

Stephen Rule 2:  Coding I do for my job will not count but extra stuff I do during lunch will count.
