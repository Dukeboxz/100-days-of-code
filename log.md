# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 28: February 6, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:  Today was a bit more reading and a bit less coding.  I got the rest of my calulator done apart from a bit of positioning apart from that I have been having another crack at getting events from a google calendar.  After a bit of reading I think I have worked out how it could be done now I am just setting up things to do it.  My quest to get a webserver set up failed miserably installed sql server but could not connect to it and cannot get visual studio to connect to a debug broswer. Oh well It eh.

### Day 27: February 5, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:Slowly getting back into it got most of the functionality of the calculator done today.  Just need to get all the positioning of the button sorted and a good way of dealing with error in input by the user. 

### Day 26: February 4, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Ok things are calming down a little my partner is on the road to recovery and I can get back on track.  I have given myself a small project to get back into the swing of things which is the creation of a caculator in Javascript.  Did a bit tonight and hoping I will be finished in 3 days tops.  So I have lost a few days but hopefully can get back to it.  

### Day 25.5: February 2, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:Disasters all round I am afraid that have stopped this endevour cold.  My partner was taken into hospital with stomach complaints and determined she has something wrong with bowel.  Have been at hospital a lot but she is not home.  This has meant coding at night has been suspended for current time.  


### Day 25: January 30, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:so fittingly on the 25 day of this challenge I have completed a website and uploaded it on the cloud for all to see.
My thought on completing 25 days is I have learned a bit about web development and styling.  My next project will be to add server functionality to the webpage.  I am also going to start moving on to app development since that is something I have been interested in.  Will have to do a lot more learning on that.

### Day 22: January 27, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:Back on track so got a lot more work done on websites today.  Nothing really groundbreaking just implmenting the techniques and libraries that I have learned.  Hopefully will be able to publish the sites publicly soon.
**Thoughts:** Still dont feel I have mastered CSS yet

### Day 21: January 26, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:This is the problem with tryig to do coding when you are tired.  Not a lot of progress tonight was changing my get date of next meeting function to show all future dates and was wondering why it was not working.  After some internet searching saw that it was a rookie mistake I as declaring the array in the loop so it was getting reinitalised each time.  Idiot.
**Thoughts:** Idiot Idiot IDiot


### Day 20: January 25, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:So today I have been doing more web coding and working with date and times in javascript.  This is something I have done in Java before but not something I have done in javascript.  So far so easy but in Java I had a DateTime library that gave days between dates not discovered anything like that yet in javascript.  The eagle eyed people may have noticed that I have missed a day.  Oops unfortunatley being late from work and then going out to a club till late meant that I just did not have time sorry wont happen agaiin promise.
**Thoughts:** Looked at Azure to host static website should not be too hard if I get them to a certain state.

### Day 19: January 23, 2018 

**Todays Progress**:Progress painfully slow due to illness and other commitments.  Still doing my hour but making so many silly mistakes I think I am going backwards some times.  Not helped with being stuck on a problem at work as well.  
**Thoughts:** Need to work on my posture back is really sore.

### Day 18: January 22, 2018

**Thoughts:** What have I learned?

### Day 17: January 21, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Today I have typed away at the keyboard but have not managed to make much work.  This I think is a large part due to the fact that I have been struck down by lergie(Common Cold).  This has turned my head to wool and made me not want to do anything much.  Hopefully will feel better tomorrow.
**Thoughts:** I want my bed

### Day 16: January 20, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Well today was intense, since last year I have been helping set up a code club for kids age 7 - 12.  Today we had 27 kids turn up which was great but so much work.  While the code they are doing is not challenging I do spend a lot of time explaining key programming concepts to them so I am counting it as part of my coding for today.  After that I was a bit brain dead so have done a simple UI design using the tools in visual studio.  It is something that was needed for the c# course I am going on so I thought I would get it out the way.
**Thoughts:** Loads of project idea have come out of the code club for what I could do.  First 2 that spring to mind an achievment monitoring service or doing my own simple gaem

### Day 15: January 19, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Today it was back to the website and learning Javascript libraries.  Today I was learning JQuery which people say makes things easier to code.  I can see it use in making animation on website so am going to try it.  Not much to show for it though to day was more of a learning day.

**Thoughts:** Getting increasing concerned about how slow I am going.  Maybe I need to make mine 200 days of code to achieve what other people can do in 100.

### Day 14: January 18, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Bit of a token effort today.  As soon as I was back from work I was out at a community meeting.  Got home and did a introduction to Python to remind myself of the syntax.  The code club I volunteer at uses it as a coding of minecraft so was refreshing myself on that.  Will look to expand on that an write longer code to do impressive things in minecraft for raspberry pi.

**Thoughts:** which programming languages would get together and decide once and for all if true and false start with capitals or not

### Day 13: January 17, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Back to working on the website today going to show the outline to the community group tomorrow to see if they like my ideas 
**Thoughts:** Still slow going I thought I could code quicker than this

### Day 12: January 16, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Interesting coding today I did something a bit different went to a local tech meet up and did some coding on Sonic Pi on a raspberry Pi.  Interesting getting a really different language but it was let down a little by my lack of musical ability

**Thoughts:** Not too much today

### Day 11: January 15, 2018

### Day 10: January 14, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Implemented more API to get facebook running on the website.  Still looking to get information from Google Calendars in a way that I can then manipulate them

**Thoughts:** Make a web server how?

**Link to work:**[Community Garden Page but nothing new from yesterday](https://github.com/Dukeboxz/Inspire-Community-Website/blob/master/communityGardenFrontPage.html)

### Day 9: January 13, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: Did a bit of coding but was mostly just trying to get things to look right using CSS.  I have started reading the Google Calendar API which may be a bit harder than the blogger API to get info from 

**Thoughts:** Had a meeting with people today about continuing to develop a tech club and tech meetup in Chesterfield so am keeping up the networking as well.  Looked at the course that work is sending me on and it turns out they will expect a basic knowledge of visual studio so I am going to have to spend a bit more time getting to know that paricular IDE.

### Day 8: January 12, 2018

**Thoughts:** none too tired

### Day 7: January 11, 2018 

**Todays Progress**: A good day all round today I got the blog and the twitter feed to display on the website.  Next is to make those refresh at a certain rate and look to embed events from google calendar and facebook posts

**Thoughts:** Tired but happy however keeping this up is going to face some challenges.  No least because if February work are sending me on a intensive 5 day course in London to learn C# not sure how much coding I would want to do each night after that.

Stephen Rule 1:  May be days where due to childcare commitments 1 hour will not be possible.  Will do extra on other days to make up.

Stephen Rule 2:  Coding I do for my job will not count but extra stuff I do during lunch will count.
